    <div style="font-family:verdana;padding:20px;border-radius:10px;border:10px solid rgb(27, 211, 211);border-radius: 20px;border-width: 3px;">
    
    <font face="微软黑体">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bid farewell to the green youth and the high school life full of memories. Now I have ushered in a new life, which has always made me look forward to my college life. Here, I will start planning my new journey.
            <p></p>
    Ⅰ、Self Inventory Analysis
    <br>My advantage:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a boy unwilling to be ordinary. I always have an unyielding belief in my heart. I think every day will be a new beginning. In the face of new hope, I have no reason to escape. Treat learning, love learning and study hard; Treat students, I am lenient and helpful; Treat myself strictly and adhere to principles; I have a correct attitude towards work and a sense of responsibility; Treat life, I love life, positive and optimistic, hard work. Therefore, facing the future, I am full of confidence. No matter how hard the road of life is, I will bravely go on until I succeed.
    <br>
    My disadvantage:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past three years of senior high school, my expression ability is not good, and my communication ability in case of trouble is limited. Because there is no environment like university, I have basically no experience in speaking, especially my oral English ability is weak. I will be shy in the face of some things and dare not speak actively. Like photography, singing, writing, badminton, e - sports
   <P></P>
   Ⅱ、External environment analysis
   <br>
   1. English is becoming more and more important in daily life, study and work. As the most commonly used language in the world, English will certainly Herald further contact with the world. China faces the world and world integration requires us to have a certain level of English use and expression.
   <P></P>
   2. The advent of the information age requires us to master certain computer knowledge. Using computer and network is the basic skill that everyone must have, just like using paper and pen. If you don't learn computer well, you can't get the knowledge or information you need quickly and comprehensively.
   <P></P>
   3. The severe employment situation requires us to be prominent not only in one aspect, but in all aspects. The society needs talents in all aspects, and the cultivation of ability is particularly important.
   <P></P>
   Ⅲ、Goal setting
   <br>
   Freshman: exploratory period: just entering the University, you should adapt to the life of the University, exercise and improve your abilities, change your learning habits, clarify your interests, actively join the community, cultivate friendship, establish good interpersonal relationships, improve your independent ability and trading means, and strive to pass CET-4.
   <P></P>
   Sophomore year: orientation period: when all aspects have stabilized. We should focus on learning, focus on professional courses, strive to learn English well, and strive to pass CET-6 and computer CET-2. Work moderately, contact the society, actively participate in social practice activities, cultivate social practice ability, and further improve yourself, so as to take an important step in the future.
   <P></P>
   Junior: sprint period: Junior is equivalent to senior two at that time, which determines the future learning career. Therefore, we need to strengthen our professional skill training and pass some professional qualification certification examinations. At the same time, contact the society more, cultivate the ability of social practical experience, and exercise their working ability and application ability. As a student majoring in electronic information engineering, I need to further study and make good preparations for the postgraduate entrance examination.
   <P></P>
   Senior year: differentiation period: the students' Association is busy, some working and some taking the postgraduate entrance examination, making clear their own direction for their future direction, immersing themselves in their postgraduate entrance examination and learning, and doing appropriate work in order to cultivate social practice ability.
